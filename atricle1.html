 <i>"Bullying is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse, intimidate, or aggressively dominate others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of social or physical power. Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal harassment or threat, physical assault or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets. Rationalizations for such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size or ability.''
    </i>-via Wikipedia.

<p class="p1">    
Bullying is everywhere around us. Many people are being bullied, for various reasons. But they are afraid to speak, because they are worried about their safety, or because they think that no one can help them. The victims of bullying lose self-confidence, become aggressive, they isolate themselves, or even worse they become bullies themselves and in some cases, they even harm themselves, especially when the victims are kids or adolescents.
<br><br>
But what about the bullies? What makes them being so mean towards other people, especially children to other children? In most cases, envy is the most common motive for some, to bully others.Many times though, many kids become bullies because they are abused by their family, especially the parents. When a child faces physical and/or verbal violence, is being bullied itself. As a result, a vicious circle begins.
<br><br>
Now,let's see what can the victims do, as well as each one of us, if we witness a person being bullied.
<br><br>
If you are being bullied, don't keep quiet, even if the bullies threaten you that they will hurt you if you say anything. Speak to a person you trust. A teacher, your parents, your best friend. Open up and they will do their best, in order to keep you safe. Also, don't lose your self-esteem. They try to bring you down, which means that you do something right. They are jealous of you, because they can not be successful as you are.
<br><br>
Teachers should always be prepared for any incident of bullying at schools and if they know any students who are bullies, they should check out what are the conditions at his/her family and home, because maybe the child is being abused.
<br><br>
Users of social media, as well as supervisors of social media, such as Facebook,Twitter and YouTube, should be careful. On one side, users should not use bad and hateful words towards others, because the people who accept those kind of comments, might hurt themselves. Also, if they notice that another user is a cyber-bully, they should report it immediately.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the people who are in charge at social media, should take action as well. For example, they could set up some rules, which would include the people who are being hateful towards others, would not be allowed to use the particular website anymore.
<br><br>
March 6, is the National Day Against Bullying in Greece. May this day be the beginning of better days, without bullying and more harmony.
